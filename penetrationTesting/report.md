## What I learned
I learned that programmers are only told what not to do and why when it comes to security but not how to exploit that security hole. I don't think any of the instruction properly prepared me for this deliverable. Even my partner who took a security class about web technology couldn't initially find anything out of the ordinary. This could be from my inexprience with JavaScript.
